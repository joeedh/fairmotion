#Intro

Fairmotion is an advanced vector graphics/animation editor, written in HTML5 and ES6.

It is based on the principle of never, ever (ever!) using polynomials for
visual curves. Instead, it integrates a transendental polynomial
spiral, kindof like Raph Levien's Spiro curves:

http://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html

Intead of interpolating x and y separately with two polynomials, 
*one* polynomial (a cubic bezier) is used to define a plane
curve's *curvature function.*  This is then reverse integrated
to get a much nicer looking curve than you would get from stuff like
Bezier curves or B-Splines.

Fairmotion is very much a work in progress, and should be considered pre-alpha.

### Build
To build, open a command prompt where you downloaded fairmotion
and execute these commands:

    pip install ply
    python configure.py
    ./js_build

#### Excluding PhoneGap From Build
The phonegap build can be a bit slow.  To exclude it,
open platforms/build_local.py (which was generated by configure.py)
and uncomment all the lines except for `platforms.PhoneGap.build,`, like so:

    #example build_local.py
    
    import platforms.chromeapp.build
    import platforms.html5.build
    import platforms.PhoneGap.build
    import platforms.Electron.build

    build_platforms = [
      platforms.chromeapp.build,
      platforms.html5.build,
      #platforms.PhoneGap.build,
      platforms.Electron.build
    ]


Note that if inkscaped is installed, the build process
will attempt to render an SVG iconsheet (see src/datafiles/iconsheet.svg).
The build system treats iconsheet.svg as any other source file, and will
detect changes to it.

### Running The Electron App
    ./dist/run_electron.sh
Or for Windows:

    .\dist\run_electron.bat
